wwallo is a tag cloud for wherever you happen to be.


WHY?

Wouldn't it be cool if locations were tagged just like websites?

If you're stuck in traffic or wandering through an unfamiliar place,
your location is tagged by what people have been saying around you.
Maybe they're in a frenzy about an accident that has traffic at a
standstill or ranting about some local event. Maybe the buzz is
about the outbreak of the zombie plague (in which case you should
get out of there ASAP :)


WHAT AND WHY?

wwallo is a twitter client and an excuse to experiment with the
kickass WebMachine, jQuery (and a lot of jQuery plugins) and the
geolocation features of Google Gears.

wwallo geolocates the client by using Google Gears (tested with the
web browser on an Android phone and firefox on Mac OS X and Ubuntu).
If Gears is not installed, wwallo falls back to using the IP address
to lookup the client's location. Finally, if the client source IP
address is within the private range, wwallo resorts to using its
public IP address.
